spread operator vs object.assign - more readable but less stable?

structure - reducers with actions or separate?

dom structure - one big app component or separate components rendered individually?

components - i think a separation of functional and visual components is a good idea, but do we allow ambiguous components? should all
functional components connect to a visual component or can we have some overlap? each option adds and removes different kinds of complexity

how deep do we want to go with state? should the contents of text boxes be registered in redux?
